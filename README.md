# Uptime

Tell how long the system has been running on unix-like systems.

## Why?

I created this mini project to check basic features of cmocka.
It is based on the uptime example available in the official cmocka repo.

## Dependencies
- `sudo apt install libcmocka-dev`

## How to build

```
make main   to build the main program
make test   to build the test suite
make clean  to clean objects
```
